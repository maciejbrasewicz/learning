# Learning app Template Integration Issue

This repository contains the code for a Flutter project where I've attempted to integrate the FlutKit "learning app" template. Below are the steps I've followed and the issue I'm encountering.

## Steps Followed

1. **Created a new Flutter project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Used the option `Flutter > New Flutter Project > Application`.

2. **Added FlutKit files to the project**
   - Copied the `learning` folder (containing subfolders like `helpers`, `extensions`, `theme`, `util`, `widgets`, etc.) and files like `loading_effective_.dart` and `images.dart` into the `lib` directory.
   - Added the `Assets` folder to the root of the project.

3. **Updated the `pubspec.yaml` file**
   - Replaced the default `pubspec.yaml` with the one provided by FlutKit.
   - Updated the `name` field in `pubspec.yaml` to match my project's name.

4. **Fetched dependencies**
   - Ran `flutter pub get`.

5. **Updated import statements**
   - Replaced all instances of `package:velora` with `package:my_app_name` in the code to ensure proper import paths.

6. **Ran the application**
   - Executed `flutter run`. The build completed successfully, but the default Flutter starter app is the one that launches.

## The Issue

The problem seems to stem from the fact that the `main.dart` file is still the default one generated by Flutter. My goal is to run the FlutKit "learning app" template. According to the documentation, I shouldn't need to change `main.dart`, but leaving it as is results in the default Flutter app being launched when I run the project.

A new Flutter project.
